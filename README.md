# Grass Roots

Grass Roots is a service for the assessment of an elderly persons wellbeing. 
These tests will be carried out at care points of an older persons days - like local pharmacy, GP or with their at home nurse - to ensure that they have no issues with the accessibility of the service.

This project has won the 2017 eHealth Ireland Innovation Hackathon in Accenture @ The Dock on 22/10/17.
